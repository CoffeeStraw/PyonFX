title: Install & Set-up
---

## Prerequisites

To get started with PyonFX, we recommend that you have some knowledge on:

- **Python 3**: familiarity with basic constructs like variables, functions, conditions, loops, comparisons, string formatting, lists, and dictionaries[^py];
- **ASS/SSA Tags**: familiarity with ASS tags[^ass];

## Installation

??? note "Windows"
    Download and install Python 3 from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Ensure you check "Add Python 3.x to PATH". Then, install PyonFX:

    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade pyonfx
    ```

??? note "Ubuntu/Debian"
    Install prerequisites:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install libgirepository-2.0-dev gobject-introspection libcairo2-dev python3-dev build-essential gir1.2-gtk-3.0 python3-gi python3-gi-cairo
    ```

    Then, install PyonFX:

    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install --upgrade pyonfx
    ```

??? note "macOS"
    Install Homebrew if needed, then install prerequisites:

    ```bash
    brew install python py3cairo pygobject3 pango cairo glib
    ```

    Then, install PyonFX:

    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install --upgrade pyonfx
    ```

    If you encounter rendering issues, try:

    ```bash
    PANGOCAIRO_BACKEND=fc python3 namefile.py
    ```


### Additional Setup

Enhance your development workflow by setting up your environment as follows:

- We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as your text editor. For helpful code suggestions and error checking, install the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) and, if desired, [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance) for enhanced type support;
- If you want your Python script to run automatically every time you save, add also the [RunOnSave](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=emeraldwalk.RunOnSave) extension;
- Install the [MPV player](https://mpv.io/) for lightweight, hot-reload output preview without relying on Aegisub. On Windows, add the folder containing MPVâ€™s executable (typically `C:\Program Files\mpv`) to your system PATH (if you don't know how, follow [this guide](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/)).
