PyonFX is a Python library that helps you combine tags, text, and shapes following the ASS format. It also supports tasks like timecode adjustments and layering with the help of the extra data included within an ASS file.

And that's not all! PyonFX also offers some special functions to help you perform tricky tasks, such as frame-by-frame operations, shape manipulation, or pixel-by-pixel effects. This makes it much easier to create **impressive visual 2D effects**.

In comparison to other karaoke effect programs, PyonFX is written in [Python3](https://www.python.org/), which gives you all the advantages of a modern, updated scripting language suitable for both beginners and advanced users.

You can learn how to start using the library in the [Quick Start Guide](quick%20start.md).
