## What *is* PyonFX?

PyonFX is a **Python library** designed to make the creation of **KFX (Karaoke Effects)** and **complex typesetting** easy when working with the **ASS (*Advanced Substation Alpha*)** subtitle format. It provides creators with precise, programmatic control over visual effects by allowing detailed manipulation of tags, text, and shapes ‚Äî extending down to the *frame-by-frame* and *pixel-by-pixel* level.

## Key features at a glance

* **High-level dataclasses**: parse .ass file into structured objects (`Meta`, `Style`, `Line`, `Word`, `Syllable`, `Char`), incorporating font metrics and temporal/positional data;
* **Shape manipulation**:
    * **Create**: generate shape objects from geometric primitives (triangle, square, heart, etc.) or custom drawing commands;
    * **Transform**: precisely map, move, align, scale, rotate, and skew shapes;
    * **Advanced editing**: supports B√©zier curve flattening and line segmentation for granular shape control;
    * **Buffer**: expand, contract, or extract outlines from shapes;
    * **Morph**: morph smoothly between 2 individual shapes or 2 collections of shapes;
* **Frame-by-frame**: work at the individual frame level, with support for timestamp-based editing (ideal for handling CFR and VFR videos) and built-in utilities to automatically interpolate values between key frames using Penner's easing functions;
* **Pixel-by-pixel**: rasterize text or shapes for direct pixel access, and mask them with images;
* **Colour utilities**: make your KFX lines change seamlessly based on video content, and work with HSV, OKLab, RGB, and ASS color spaces;
* **Live preview**: integrate with MPV for real-time previewing. Changes to scripts are reflected on reload, allowing workflows independent of traditional Aegisub-based previews;
* **Performance tracker**: monitor runtime performance and generated line count;
* **Cross-platform availability**: install it via `pip` on Windows, macOS and Linux;
* **Comprehensive examples and community**: offers over `TBD` example scripts, and is supported by an active community of users.
