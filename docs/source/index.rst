The PyonFX Library Documentation
********************************

	"PyonFX is an easy way to do KFX (Karaoke Effects) and complex typesetting based on subtitle format ASS (Advanced Substation Alpha)."

PyonFX is a Python library that helps you to combine tags, text and shapes in ASS format, eventually changing times and layers, with the help of all the automatically extracted data from an input file in ASS format.

That's not all, it also offers some special functions to help you in some tricky tasks, for example frame per frame operations, shape manipulations or working pixel by pixel, so it's easier to create **impressive visual 2D effects**.

In comparison to other karaoke effect programs, PyonFX is written in `Python3 <https://www.python.org/>`_, which means that you will have all the advantages provided by this modern scripting language, constantly updated and perfect for both beginner and advanced users.

You can learn on how to start using the library on the :ref:`quick-start` section.
